# Benchmark History

This branch is maintained automatically by the Continuous Integration (CI). It contains the historical performance data and visualization assets for the project.

## Important Notice

Do not edit, rename, or delete files in this branch manually. Doing so may result in the loss of historical metrics or cause the automated workflow to fail.

## How it Works

1. The GitHub Actions workflow runs the benchmark suite on the main branch.
2. Performance metrics are extracted and compared against the previous history.
3. The new results are automatically pushed to this branch.
